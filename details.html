      <h2>Unplugged Ceremony</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>We kindly ask you to embrace our unplugged ceremony by refraining from using 
        electronic devices. Professional photos will be shared, so you can fully enjoy the experience, be present with us and don’t have to worry about the moment being captured. As soon as the ceremony is completed, you are welcome to take as many photos as you would like with friends and family throughout the evening. 
        Thank you for honouring our request.</p>

      <h2>Dress Code</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>We wanted to provide some guidance regarding the dress code. However, please feel free to wear whatever will
        make you most comfortable and please do not feel that you have to go out and buy something new to wear. <br><br>
        Our wedding will have a semi-formal dress code. <br><br>
        For the Guys, semi-formal attire typically includes dress pants paired with a long-sleeve dress shirt, and dress
        shoes. While suit jackets, ties, or even a full tuxedo is not required, you are more than welcome to wear them
        if you would like. Feel free to go all out expressing your personal style.<br><br>
        For the Ladies, semi-formal attire typically includes the following options: Cocktail dress (mid-length or
        full-length), dressy pantsuits, evening dress, dressy top with a formal skirt or tailored trousers. Again feel
        free to go all out and dress up as much as you would like. However, we want everyone to be comfortable so wear
        whatever makes you feel most comfortable, and camera ready. <br><br>
        One important thing to keep in mind: our ceremony will take place outside on grass, and you will need to walk on
        gravel to reach the reception hall. We kindly ask you to consider your shoe selection accordingly. For the
        ladies, flat, low or thick heeled shoes are recommended. <br><br>
        The colour scheme for our wedding is black and white, you can wear whatever colour you would like, no need to
        shy away from wearing black, in fact we encourage it! However, it goes without saying, ladies, don’t wear a white
        dress, Elysha already called dibs. <br><br>
        We are looking forward to seeing everyone looking amazing as we know you all will.

      </p>

      <h2>Kids</h2>
      <hr>

      <p>Your kids are more than welcome to attend our wedding and we
        would love to see them there. However, if you would rather find
        a babysitter and have a child-free evening, we would love
        that too. <br><br>

        If your kids are attending the wedding, we ask that you keep
        your eyes on them at all times and keep them close. Around the
        wedding venue, there are some ponds, steep banks, and forestry
        areas where kids could easily get injured.<br><br>

        We also understand that children, with their boundless energy
        and unpredictable moods, may occasionally become overwhelmed
        or restless. If your little ones happen to start crying or
        become disruptive during the ceremony or reception, please
        know that we completely understand. We want everyone, including
        parents, to fully enjoy the day without unnecessary stress.
        Therefore, we kindly request that if such a situation arises,
        you feel free to take a moment outside the main event area to
        attend to your child's needs. We greatly appreciate your
        understanding and cooperation on this matter.
      </p>

      <h2>Food </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        We will be serving some very light nibbles after the ceremony and
        will be serving dinner later in the evening at 6:30pm. For this
        reason, we ask that you please eat lunch before arriving. Your
        comfort and enjoyment throughout the day are important to us, and
        having a satisfying meal beforehand will help make the celebration
        even more memorable.</p>

      <h2>Drinks</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>We will have a limited bar tab open at the reception, if you
        think you would like more than a few drinks, we kindly ask that
        you bring eftpos to purchase more drinks after the tab has
        been used. As the venue is a winery, there is a strict policy
        of not supplying your own drinks, we kindly ask that you
        respect this policy and do not bring any of your own drinks.
        We also kindly ask that everyone drink responsibly and make
        plans to carpool with sober drivers. </p>

      <h2>Plus ones </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Our wedding venue has a limited patron capacity,
        this has meant that we have had to be intentional about
        our guest list. In order to ensure an intimate gathering
        with our closest family and friends, we kindly request
        that the invitation is extended only to those whose names
        are explicitly mentioned when we distributed the
        invitations. We hope you understand our decision to not
        allow plus ones and hope that you will attend and enjoy
        the evening with those invited.
      </p>

      <h2> Smoking</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Our wedding venue (in particular the reception hall) has a
        high fire risk. For this reason, and for the respect of
        those who do not smoke, we ask that you refrain from
        smoking or vaping as much as possible on our wedding day.
        If you need to smoke, we kindly ask that you do so on
        the far side of the gravel carpark, at least 100 metres
        from the building and other wedding guests. We thank you
        for your understanding surrounding this matter.
