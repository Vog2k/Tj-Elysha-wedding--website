          <h1>Timothy Leatau</h1>

          <p>" I was feeling pretty low one day, and decided to try my luck on Tinder. I wasn't really expecting much, but I figured it couldn't hurt to put myself out there.
            As I swiped through profiles, I came across a beautiful girl with a great smile. Her name was Elysha  Larking, and I couldn't help but feel drawn to her. I decided to take the plunge and message her.
            To my surprise, she messaged first and beat me to it, right away we started chatting. We quickly discovered that we had a lot in common and we both shared
            the same sense of humor. We made plans to meet up in person mid covid crisis , yes i know naughty haha but to our suprise 1 and half months down the track we finaly got to meet in person. <br> <br>
            When I saw her in person, I knew right away that she was special. We had an instant connection and the conversation just flowed naturally. We talked for a total of 6 hours about everything and anything, and I knew I had to see her again.
            We started dating and it's been a wild ride ever since. We've been together for over 2 years now and every day just keeps getting better. I never would have thought that I could find love on a dating app, but Elysha proved me wrong.
            I'm so glad I swiped right that day on tinder, it was the best decision I've made."
