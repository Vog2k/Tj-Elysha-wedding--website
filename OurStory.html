          <h1>Timothy Leatau</h1>
          <br>
          <p>"I was feeling pretty low one day decided to try my luck on Tinder. I wasn't really expecting much, but I figured it couldn't hurt to put myself out there.
            As I swiped through profiles, I came across a beautiful girl with a great smile. Her name was Elysha  Larking, and I couldn't help but feel drawn to her. I decided to take the plunge and message her.
            To my surprise, she messaged first and beat me to it, right away we started chatting. We quickly discovered that we had a lot in common and we both shared
            the same sense of humour. We made plans to meet up in person mid covid crisis, but to our surprise, 1 and a half months down the track, we finally got to meet in person. <br> <br>
            When I saw her in person, I knew right away that she was special. We had an instant connection and the conversation just flowed naturally. We talked for a total of 6 hours about everything and anything, and I knew I had to see her again.
            We started dating and it's been a wild ride ever since. We've been together for over 3 years now and every day just keeps getting better. I never would have thought that I could find love on a dating app, but Elysha proved me wrong.
            I'm so glad I swiped right that day on tinder, it was the best decision I've made."

<br>
          <p>"Three years in and I still get the same butterflies I did on our very first date.
            I think back to matching with TJ online and think how lucky we are to have met this way. We lived on opposite sides of the city, working in completely different industries, with completely different social circles, there is no other way that we would’ve met and I will be forever grateful that we did. <br><br>
            When I matched with TJ, I felt an instant connection. We conversed through messages for hours, non stop everyday for over a month. Covid lockdowns meant we had to wait longer than we would’ve liked to meet in person. <br><br> At the time, it was sad that our dates kept getting cancelled by lockdowns, but now looking back, I think those weeks of messaging allowed us to get to know each other really well. When the lockdown was finally lifted, I think we were both a bit nervous that the connection we felt through messaging would not convey the same in person. Luckily we had nothing to worry about, as our first date consisted solely of us sitting at the beach and talking non stop for 6 hours! 
            From the very start we were very intentional about our relationship, making sure to discuss everything we wanted for our lives, we knew straight away that we wanted the same things and that we have the same values and beliefs. <br><br>  People often ask what was the moment I knew he was the one, it’s alway been hard for me to pinpoint an exact moment and I think that’s because I’ve always known, there has never been a doubt in my mind that TJ was not going to be my future husband. People say, when you know, you know, and I truly believe this. 
            From day one TJ has made me feel so loved. As young girls, we dream about what our husbands will be like, and I honestly could not have dreamed of a better man to be mine. 
            I love you TJ, and I can not wait to marry you! xx"
